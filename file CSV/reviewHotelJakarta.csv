ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,Muthia Azhari,5.0,"During my stay, the room was good, nice design and clean. No issues at all. The public facilities were fine, and breakfast was okay too. But the air freshener in the lobby was pretty strong and a bit unpleasant. Maybe it‚Äôs just personal preference, though. The rest of the hotel‚Äôs scent was fine, just the lobby one was a bit too much."
ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,Stephen Hilsum,4.0,"A pleasant hotel. Clean, comfortable room. Excellent powerful shower.

However, despite some of the hotel's media advertising 24-hour room service, I was disappointed to discover - when I was hungry at 11pm - that room service finishes at 10pm. I sent a complaint to the Manager about this. Although I am similarly disappointed not to have received the courtesy of a reply from the Manager, I notice that the hotel's website has been amended to show that room service is not available for 24 hours. Whilst many hotels did cut back on their room-service hours during the pandemic, I would expect now a 4* hotel to provide 24-hour room service, even if it's with a reduced menu at night."
ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,Celia,5.0,"nice hotel rooms here, the facilities are good üëç i stayed with my family, near gandaria city or pondok indah mall. The breakfast was also good üëç i love it! free of parking charge for grab driver, just tell the lobby about your room stay and the car plate number üòÅ"
ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,Trip.com Member,4.5,Very convenient location. Less than 5 minutes drive to PIM mall. The staffs are very friendly and ready to assist you. The room is spacious and clean. The breakfast place was very crowded tho. I couldn‚Äôt find place to sit for breakfast.
ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,Rizky,4.0,"Stayed here for 2 nights.

The room was good, clean, spacious, and the ac was working properly. The shower head needs to be cleaned though.

My only complaint here is on the breakfast service, i can't found any coffee cup! There were only 2 which i believed was used as it has traces of coffee inside it. And the taste of the overall breakfast is okay which is disappointing for Aston."
ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,Aaliya Mia,5.0,"Modern and beautifully decorated hotel. Rooms are comfortable with an excellent bed and pillows.

Service is excellent and all requests are attended to promptly.

The Breakfast buffet offers a good selection of options, mostly Indonesian with some western options. The pastries are superb."
ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,Fakhri M,5.0,"I booked 2 night for my anniversary trip. The staff really helpful especially the one named Fahrezy. He helped me with the surprise. Then on my breakfast my slipper was broken, without I asking for it, staff respond it with new slippers. So, I am amazed with the staff||The hotel itself really comfortable and worth for money. The location also great because it was accessible to anywhere."
ASTON Bellevue Radio Dalam,YOUNG IN OH,1.0,"I rarely write negative reviews, but this time, I must say that the Aston Bellevue Hotel appears to have various issues. When selecting a hotel for the business trip team in Jakarta, our main considerations were accessibility and ease of travel to other regions, which led us to choose Aston Bellevue. However, the process of making reservations and handling changes was extremely inconvenient, and the attitude of the manager and staff‚Äîprioritizing the hotel's interests over customer satisfaction‚Äîwas downright unpleasant.

For instance, a request to change the reservation name and a simple dinner request around 10 PM, when we were expected to arrive at the hotel, were denied because ""no services could be provided before check-in."" Upon arrival, we discovered that the restaurant had already closed, leaving no options for food. When I inquired with the team about the hotel‚Äôs internal conditions and their experience, all members expressed disappointment, citing that the facilities were outdated for the price range, and many were in poor hygienic and functional condition.

The reception, restaurant, and staff were neither friendly nor skilled, providing subpar service that failed to meet even basic standards. A hotel should prioritize offering its guests a comfortable stay and a sense of security during their travels. However, Aston Bellevue seemed entirely focused on maximizing profits, showing no concern for guest satisfaction or convenience.

Even the Christmas tree in the lobby appeared hastily assembled without effort or care, resembling something one might see in a private home rather than a professional establishment. While small and simple details, they reflected a broader lack of commitment to fulfilling the fundamental duties of a hotel. Aston Bellevue gave the impression of a place operating with the mindset of ""take it or leave it"" and prioritizing profit over hospitality.

To summarize, this is a hotel I would never want to return to. It is embarrassing that a hotel of such poor standards exists in such a central location in Jakarta. Recommending this hotel to the team brought me significant embarrassment and discomfort, and it failed to meet expectations on every level."

Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Reynaldi N,5.0,"My short stay at this hotel was fantastic! The staff were friendly, the check-out process was quick, and they even have a separate restaurant for meals. I particularly enjoyed having breakfast on the 7th floor, as it was peaceful and more laid-back compared to the 5th floor. An added bonus was receiving a complimentary healthy drink because the cook accidentally left an apple sticker in it. As for the room, it was spacious with lovely decor. The only downsides were the missing bathroom mat and the overly soft pillow - I prefer a firmer buckwheat one. The staff were attentive and made sure everyone's needs were met throughout my stay."
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Abang A,5.0,"The room is very clean, the staff is very helpful. As an Accor's Platinum member, I should have gotten a room upgrade, but unfortunately the room was fully booked. Then i got a dining voucher as a replacement. The welcome drink was good. The executive lounge is okay. Next time I will come back as soon as possible to get more experience in this hotel, hopefully I can get a chance to get a room upgrade. One more thing, hopefully all rooms will have smart TV, because only a few have smart TV installed. thanks"

Kemang Icon Jakarta,Robin Thuresson,1.0,"One of the worst hotels I have stayed at. Everything is super run down. I stayed there 20 years ago and it was fantastic. As others have already mentioned the rooms look good in the pictures but it is so run down and you can see they have done quick fixes to fix things and no major maintenance in years.

There is no free water in the room (which is standard for even 3* hotels in indonesia)

Electricity randomly turned off in the room and had to call electrician

Elevator didn‚Äôt go my level so had to walk 1 flight of stairs

Restaurant upstairs was closed and no room service, so had to order gofood

Door handle feel off to door.

Only 1 (of 2) AC units working so was extremely hot and uncomfortable

Construction upstairs so loud noises

Only good thing was the breakfast, which they serve to the room. There is no restaurant.

People should avoid this hotel until they actually do some maintenance and fix things. Needs major renovations."
Kemang Icon Jakarta,s m,2.0,"The service provided by the staff is heartfelt and wonderful. However, entire building has become dilapidated which has lowered our satisfaction. In particular, as shown in the attached photo, the windows are not properly fixed and there are a few mosquitoes in the room. Although renovation is nessessary, the investment has not been done long time."
Kemang Icon Jakarta,Putri Meika,1.0,"Overall Rating: 1/10

The only positive was the location.

This hotel claims to be 5-star, but it falls far short of that standard. There were numerous mosquitoes, the front desk staff was unhelpful, and the breakfast options were lacking.

The most concerning issue was a leak from the ceiling above the sink, which created a dangerous situation.

I would not recommend this hotel. Look for alternatives!"
Kemang Icon Jakarta,anita Pandan,5.0,"the Edge Kemang Icon is a fun place, has an infinity pool, can be used for various events üëçüèª The atmosphere from afternoon to night is very beautiful surrounded by tree lights, the employees are very friendly, thank you to Kemang Icon‚≠êÔ∏è‚Ä¶"

Kemang Icon Jakarta,Gio Aguste,5.0,"I had a wonderful stay at Kemang Icon Jakarta. The suite I stayed in called Ionic suite, it was not only spacious but also uniquely decorated with a classic touch, giving it a charming ambiance.

The staff, while not numerous, were incredibly friendly and attentive. They made sure I had a comfortable and enjoyable experience throughout my stay.

While the breakfast was served √† la carte rather than buffet-style, the food was absolutely delicious and satisfying.

Overall, Kemang Icon Jakarta impressed me with its spacious and charming suite, attentive staff, and delectable breakfast. It's definitely a hotel that maintains a high level of performance. Please keep the performance."
Kemang Icon Jakarta,Agus Suci Wulandari,5.0,"Love this Hotel, located in a very strategic un Kemang, you can find a lot of places for eat, leisure, and coffee (of course!)
The room is spacious enough, elegant interior,  instagramable roof top, staff are friendly. Rate of this hotel is affordable for a 4 star hotel, overall a nice experience when staying in this hotel."
Kemang Icon Jakarta,angela d,5.0,"Very nice hotel, fabulous decor. Helpful staff, great views from the rooftop. We spent 3 nights here, we would come back. The room we stayed in was huge, it had an office and a fridge freezer! Everything was clean and comfy. We had everything we needed."
Kemang Icon Jakarta,Robin Thuresson,1.0,"One of the worst hotels I have stayed at. Everything is super run down. I stayed there 20 years ago and it was fantastic. As others have already mentioned the rooms look good in the pictures but it is so run down and you can see they have done quick fixes to fix things and no major maintenance in years.

There is no free water in the room (which is standard for even 3* hotels in indonesia)

Electricity randomly turned off in the room and had to call electrician

Elevator didn‚Äôt go my level so had to walk 1 flight of stairs

Restaurant upstairs was closed and no room service, so had to order gofood

Door handle feel off to door.

Only 1 (of 2) AC units working so was extremely hot and uncomfortable

Construction upstairs so loud noises

Only good thing was the breakfast, which they serve to the room. There is no restaurant.

People should avoid this hotel until they actually do some maintenance and fix things. Needs major renovations."
Kemang Icon Jakarta,s m,2.0,"The service provided by the staff is heartfelt and wonderful. However, entire building has become dilapidated which has lowered our satisfaction. In particular, as shown in the attached photo, the windows are not properly fixed and there are a few mosquitoes in the room. Although renovation is nessessary, the investment has not been done long time."
Kemang Icon Jakarta,Putri Meika,1.0,"Overall Rating: 1/10

The only positive was the location.

This hotel claims to be 5-star, but it falls far short of that standard. There were numerous mosquitoes, the front desk staff was unhelpful, and the breakfast options were lacking.

The most concerning issue was a leak from the ceiling above the sink, which created a dangerous situation.

I would not recommend this hotel. Look for alternatives!"

While the breakfast was served √† la carte rather than buffet-style, the food was absolutely delicious and satisfying.

Here's our review:
(+)
Check in was smooth & fast
Room was spacious & clean
Breakfast had various menu & delicious
Staffs were friendly, services were excellent
Good location in the center of South Jakarta
They have a small bakery & it was a good cake & coffee
(-)
At our arrival there was a hairball & hair vitamin in the bathroom, it was minor but needs more detail in make up room.

Overall, we'd love to stay here again someday."
Sutasoma Hotel,Anneke Tamara,5.0,"Dear Sutasoma Hotel team

We recently had a pleasant stay at your hotel, and overall, it was a great experience. The staff were exceptionally friendly and attentive, always eager to accommodate our needs. A special mention goes to Lexi, the banquet waiter, who made our dining experience memorable by not only being incredibly friendly but also remembering our order each time.

The breakfast buffet was a highlight of our stay. The wide range of food selections (from  Indonesian food to Pastas and wide range of pastries) ensured that there was something for everyone, and the quality was top-notch.

Our room was spacious and comfortable, perfect for the two of us. However, there are a couple of areas where improvements could be made. The quality of the toilet paper could be upgraded to a thicker variety, and we noticed that the showerheads could use more regular maintenance. Additionally, providing a glass in the bathroom for brushing our teeth would be a thoughtful touch.

The ambiance at the restaurant was also a plus, creating a relaxed and enjoyable atmosphere for meals.

Overall, we had a great stay and would recommend your hotel, with just a few small improvements to make the experience even better. Thank you for having us!"

Jordan is not only an excellent host but also a true artist when it comes to coffee. His attention to detail and skill in crafting the perfect cup is unmatched‚ÄîI honestly didn‚Äôt want coffee from anyone else during my stay! His banter and lighthearted conversations made every morning enjoyable, and his genuine care and accommodating nature are rare to find.

It‚Äôs clear that Jordan embodies the culture of hospitality that Goodrich Suites stands for.

They were friendly, attentive, and went above and beyond to ensure my private dinner went smooth. ||One of the highlights of my visit was the private romantic dinner they helped organize.

One thing that was bothering me is hot water, you need some times to get it. But I will go back here next time!"
Goodrich Suites,Trip.com Member,2.2,"Definitely not a 5 star hotel. Room is nice & big. Staff are friendly & helpful but poorly trained. Checked me in as the wrong person & asked for payment whereas booking has already been prepaid. Called housekeeping for hand towel & face towels. They do not have. Definitely a local style hotel. Frontdesk apologies for having only a body towel, ridiculous for a ‚Äò5-star‚Äô hotel. On check out, cashier asked me if I used the minibar. But there was no minibar; it was just free coffee & tea. She refused to admit her mistake & said she will ask Housekeeping to check. Then I insisted on checking together the mysterious minibar. She finally admitted her mistake and apologised. Truly poor management, poor training of staff, take short cuts on room amenities. All very short sighted. Will not be going back after this one time. No thank you!"
Goodrich Suites,David Nash,5.0,"Had 3 nights here recently.  Fully recommend. Amazing bedrooms and a choice of activities from a gym and restaurant to a rooftop bar with live music.

Goodrich Suites,Kezia R,5.0,"This hotel has a very good facilities. The ambience of the room is great. Breakfast was good also and had so many choices. Employees are nice, friendly, and helpful. One thing that was bothering me is hot water, you need some times to get it. But I will go back here next time!"
Goodrich Suites,Trip.com Member,2.2,"Definitely not a 5 star hotel. Room is nice & big. Staff are friendly & helpful but poorly trained. Checked me in as the wrong person & asked for payment whereas booking has already been prepaid. Called housekeeping for hand towel & face towels. They do not have. Definitely a local style hotel. Frontdesk apologies for having only a body towel, ridiculous for a ‚Äò5-star‚Äô hotel. On check out, cashier asked me if I used the minibar. But there was no minibar; it was just free coffee & tea. She refused to admit her mistake & said she will ask Housekeeping to check. Then I insisted on checking together the mysterious minibar. She finally admitted her mistake and apologised. Truly poor management, poor training of staff, take short cuts on room amenities. All very short sighted. Will not be going back after this one time. No thank you!"
Goodrich Suites,David Nash,5.0,"Had 3 nights here recently.  Fully recommend. Amazing bedrooms and a choice of activities from a gym and restaurant to a rooftop bar with live music.

2 months later I have returned for a further 2 night stay so I must like it ..they even gave me the same room ..great service from the staff"
Goodrich Suites,Ravinder Singh,1.0,"Location is already an outlier compared to other 5 star destinations in Jakarta. On top of that, if you're ordering Grab food, expect 1 star treatment - go pick up your food from the basement car park. So I have to ask myself, with so many other better located 5 star hotels with competitive prices, why should I stay here?"
Goodrich Suites,Hari Nagaraju,5.0,"Overall it was a good stay. Located in Central Area. Staffs are amazing and very helpful. Impressed with their variety range of breakfast for a suites hotel.

Torres is one their staff whom always greets with and constantly asks how we are doing and willing to extend any help."
Goodrich Suites,MohammadAli Merchant,5.0,"I recently stayed at Goodrich Suites, and the highlight of my experience was the exceptional service provided by Jordan. From the moment I walked in, his friendly and welcoming demeanor made me feel right at home.

Jordan is not only an excellent host but also a true artist when it comes to coffee. His attention to detail and skill in crafting the perfect cup is unmatched‚ÄîI honestly didn‚Äôt want coffee from anyone else during my stay! His banter and lighthearted conversations made every morning enjoyable, and his genuine care and accommodating nature are rare to find.

It‚Äôs clear that Jordan embodies the culture of hospitality that Goodrich Suites stands for. Because of him, I‚Äôll not only be recommending this hotel to others but will also make it a point to return. Thank you, Jordan, for making my stay so memorable. You‚Äôre the reason Goodrich feels like a home away from home!"

They were friendly, attentive, and went above and beyond to ensure my private dinner went smooth. ||One of the highlights of my visit was the private romantic dinner they helped organize.

Hotel Gran Mahakam,Bella Priscilla S,5.0,"Service is extremely good, very attentive, offering us with all kinds of food making sure we got to try everything. Food was nice, tasty and fulfilling.

Hotel Gran Mahakam,NA R,5.0,"Staying here for 2 nights was really comfortable. I‚Äôve been staying here often since the early 2000s, and I just stayed here again recently. The hotel‚Äôs condition has remained consistently good.
The service is excellent.
All the staff are friendly.
The location is strategic in South Jakarta.
Surrounded by malls, food spots, reflexology places, money changers, etc.
The room rates are also quite reasonable.
Overall, I‚Äôm very satisfied with my stay here.
I‚Äôll definitely come back to stay here again."
Hotel Gran Mahakam,Andreas Koch,5.0,"The Gran Mahakam is not just any hotel. Even the taxi driver called it a legend in Jakarta.
When you first enter, you think of a scene from Kevin Alone at Home.
Everything is dignified, the furnishings and the building are wonderfully classic.
Like a grand hotel in Vienna.

But there is one small difference. Just as the Gran is missing the fifth letter in its name, everything in the Gran Mahakam is a little smaller.
The entrance hall, the square in front of the hotel, the pool on the roof. But that was never a problem for me.

There are other things that I haven't seen anywhere else. Ironed and daily changed shower curtains, a small in-house clinic or personalised surprises for a guest's birthday.
Also worth mentioning is the favourable location in the middle of an incredible selection of excellent restaurants, all within walking distance.

But the most important thing that the Gran Mahakam has that sets it apart from most other good hotels:
It has character, a kind of personality, or let's just call it a soul.

The wonderful thing about this hotel is the people who work here.
And it's not primarily about the fact that I, as a guest, am addressed with exemplary friendliness by each and every one of them.
The most important thing is the team spirit of the staff. The colleagues work as a team. At the Gran Mahakam, there is only one ‚Äòwe‚Äô.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank the management for this.
This is only possible if the demands placed on employees are feasible and not superhuman, as is unfortunately all too often the case.
And when the focus is not on profit, but on satisfied guests.

There is no doubt that the Gran Mahakam rightly bears this title: We are one of the Best Hotels in the World.

Leaving now feels like a loss. I will definitely be back."
